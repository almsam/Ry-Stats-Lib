Welcome to **Project OSPREY** — *Open Source Projects for Research, Education, & You*.

We aim to foster a collaborative, professional, and respectful environment for all contributors. This document outlines the expectations and responsibilities of all participants, both on Discord and within the project repositories.

---

## Social expectations:

1. **Professionalism**:  
   No NSFW content. Keep all conversations and contributions professional and appropriate for a workplace environment. Treat everyone with respect & do your part to maintain a healthy environment.

2. **Supportive Culture**:  
   Try to help others whenever you can. We're here to learn and grow together. If someone asks a question that you think is "dumb", DO NOT make fun of or ridicule them, be nice and just answer or ignore it for someone else. We are here to promote learning and keep people as interested as possible, not to discourage anyone from contributing.

3. **Intellectual Property & Ethical Practice**:  
   No copyright or IP violations. Cite all programming based work appropriately by disclosing & forward any relevant licenses, & Cite all academic content using APA or a similar format. OSPREY is focused on contributing to the field & plagiarism is not tolerated

4. **Respect and Inclusion**:  
   Respect everyone regardless of their identity. Absolutely no tolerance for racism, transphobia, or other forms of discrimination.
    - In the cases of *Transgender & Gender Diverse* folks, misgendering or unsolicited speech on their identities is never tolerated.
    - In cases of *Racialized* folks, any speech that is discriminatory in nature towards immigrants, differing cultures, or different ethnicities is never tolerated.
    - In cases of *Disabled people*, any language that is ableist in nature or impairs their ability to participate in OSPREY projects is never tolerated
    - Uses of Slurs or any inappropriate speech is never tolerated
    - Discussion of political topics are generally frowned upon within OSPREY spaces, & are encouraged to be directed to the appropriate time & place. Should an OSPREY member decide to partake in political speech they shall do so in a respectful way & at their own risk.

5. **Enjoyment**:  
   Have fun. Enjoy the journey of learning, contributing, and collaborating.

## Violations:

OSPREY admins will generally run on a 2 strike system for Social standards, but reserve the right to issue consequences as they see fit

A first failure to adhere to the social Expectations may result in:

- A warning 
- A temporary Suspension or ban from the OSPREY community
- Transfer to another OSPREY project
- A reflection of the incident in future job references

Any further failures to adhere to the social Expectations may result in:

- A temporary or permanent Suspension or ban from the OSPREY community
- Transfer to another OSPREY project
- A reflection of the incident in future job references
- Revocation of job reference eligibility  

We believe in second chances and growth, but also in protecting our contributors and mission.

## Technical expectations:

### Developer Responsibilities

To gain credit, job reference, and be in good standing as an OSPREY Developer, you must:

1. **Issues:** Close at least 1 issue per week, & open at least 1 issue for the following week
- opening a new issue may be replaced with assigning yourself an existing issue with approval of a Project Manager, this needs to be included in the PM's weekly writeup
2. **Pull requests:** Open, review, & merge 1 PR per week
3. **Time constraints:** Invest at least 2 hours of work per week into your project

### Project Manager Responsibilities

In addition to Developer responsibilities 1 & 2, PMs must:

3. **Time constraints:** Invest at least 3 hours of work per week into your project - at least 2  for development & 1 for management
4. **Management:** Manage the Developers to ensure successful 'slow & steady' progress is made on the project
5. **Repositories:** Ensure smooth operation for the GitHub repository (make sure branches/PR's/code review, testing, documentation, & the best software development practices are being followed)
6. **Write ups:** Write a small message (min 50 words) to an OSPREY Admin to provide updates as to the progress of the project

- The writeup must exceed 100 words for the first 3 weeks of the project & must exceed 50 for every week after that

## Violations:

### Developer Violations:

OSPREY admins will generally run on a 3 strike system for Technical standards, but reserve the right to issue consequences as they see fit

A first failure to adhere to the Technical Expectations may result in:

- A warning 
- Transfer to another OSPREY project

Any further failures to adhere to the Technical Expectations may result in:

- Transfer to another OSPREY project
- A reflection of the repeated failures in future job references
- Revocation of job reference eligibility
- A temporary or permanent Suspension or ban from the OSPREY community

We believe in second chances and growth, but also in ensuring the quality of our products


### Project Manager Violations:

OSPREY admins will hold project managers to a similar if not higher standard to developers, so as a result violations of the PM regulations will generally be more harsh then the developer criteria. In addition to this:

Any repeated failures to adhere to the Social or Technical Expectations may also result in Revocation of the Project Manager role & demotion to a Developer

---

## Exceptions & Appeals:

### Appeals for Social Standard Violations:

Should an OSPREY Developer or Project Manager take issues with the decisions of the OSPREY admin team, there are 2 cases for the appeals process:
- Victimless social standard violations may be appealed through apology to a member of OSPREY admin
- Social standard violations with victims may be appealed through the victim receiving an apology & recommending the admin decision be appealed

### Appeals for Technical Standard Violations:

Appeals for violating technical standards will generally be granted with conversation with OSPREY admin members, however repeated appeals aren't guaranteed to pass as the intention behind this clause is personal emergencies not penalizing your progress

Appeals for smaller violations may also be granted by Project Managers

### Additional General appeals case:

In the event that the above cases for appeals fail, a final method of appeal may be executed by getting 2 other OSPREY members agree to review an appeals case & provide an alternative decision to the OSPREY admins decision. This is primarily intended for cases with conflicts of interest within the involved parties impeding normal appeals processes.
