# *R Project* projects

Just a few projects I made using R for various credits during undergrad - made public for reference & education :3

Enjoy Y'ALL!

## Course details

### Data 301 (not included)
The first data course I took was a simple data visualization in Python course. The course won't be included in this repo as none of the course was conducted in R.

However: the course project can be seen here: [*https://github.com/almsam/DATA-301-analysis-project*](https://github.com/almsam/DATA-301-analysis-project)

And a remastered version of the project can be seen here: [*github.com/almsam/data-analysis-project-remastered*](https://github.com/almsam/data-analysis-project-remastered)
**(see the Data 311 project, as remastering this involved a ton of overlap)*

### Data 310
This was a course on classical machine learning - Applied Regression Analysis - where we learnt how to derive the linear regression algorithm from scratch & how to use it in the world

Show this project some love: [*github.com/almsam/Numerical-Analysis-code*](https://github.com/almsam/Numerical-Analysis-code)

### Data 311
This course covered the entire tip of the machine learning iceberg - we covered decision trees, neural networks, regression, component analysis, & clustering

Check out my work being applied here: [*github.com/almsam/data-analysis-project-remastered*](https://github.com/almsam/data-analysis-project-remastered), which includes both the skills I learnt in data 301 & data 311 combined

### Data 315
An extension for 310 - this course showed my cohort & I how to analyze a time series of data. From white noise to Moving Average & Auto Regression, & even ARMA, ARiMA, & sARiMA - we learnt how to model seasonal data of many kinds

Stay tuned, as someday I will add my applications of these algorithms to my [*Python Library from data 310*](https://github.com/almsam/Numerical-Analysis-code)

### Data 405
After learning basic & intermediate statistics, this course on simulation & modeling browses through a wide variety of statistical models in tandem with random number generation. Think stochastic processes, Monte Carlo simulations, & Markov Chains - as well as poison & normal distributions
